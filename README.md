# Hi there! 👋 I'm Sergey Moryakov, a Dreamer of Skies and Codes.

## About Me

🚀 Once a young dreamer fascinated by the mysteries of the skies and the magic of coding, I embarked on an incredible journey in the aviation world. For over two decades, I soared in the realms of commercial aviation, embracing roles from an airline technician to a sales leader. Now, reigniting my early passion for coding, I'm charting a new course in the world of web development. While the destination is yet unknown, I invite you to join me on this exciting journey. Let's explore the limitless possibilities together!

🌍 Based in Helsinki, Finland, I blend my rich aviation experience with my newfound enthusiasm for technology, aiming to fuse these two worlds creatively.

## What I'm Currently Doing

🌱 I'm currently diving deep into the ocean of web development. My toolkit is ever-expanding, with a focus on web technologies like React.js and TypeScript. Through Harvard's CS50 courses and an intensive Front-End Development Bootcamp, I'm constantly learning, growing, and embracing the thrill of innovation.

## Seeking New Opportunities

🚀 Eager to bring a unique blend of aviation insights and web development skills, I'm searching for a web developer role. I aim to contribute innovative solutions and engaging user experiences by integrating my industry knowledge with my technical skills. My enthusiasm for teamwork and exploring new frontiers positions me perfectly for teams that value vision and creativity.
