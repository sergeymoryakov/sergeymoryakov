# Hi There! 👋 I'm Sergey, Where Sky Meets Code.

## About Me

🚀 I've always been curious about flying and coding. After almost 30 years in aviation, from fixing planes to leading sales teams, I'm now excited to focus on coding again. I'm starting a new adventure in software development and I'd love for you to join me. Let's discover what we can do together!

🌍 Living in Helsinki, Finland, I'm combining my knowledge of aviation with my love for technology.

## What I'm Currently Doing

🌱 I'm diving into web development now. My main tools are JavaScript, React.js and TypeScript. I'm learning a lot through Harvard's CS50 courses and a Front-End Development Bootcamp. Every day, I'm getting better and enjoying this new challenge.

## Seeking New Opportunities

🚀 I'm looking for a role as a web developer where I can mix my aviation background with my coding skills. I want to create new things and make user experiences that stand out. I'm ready to work with a team that's forward-thinking and innovative.
